        <h2>The Budapest Times</h2>
        <p>“So many restaurants line the street at the heart of District V around Váci utca, summer terraces spilling out onto the pavement and waiters at the ready to entice you with a menu, that it is not always an easy task to distinguish one from the other. This cannot be said about Fruccola, whose green and white signposting at its entrance gives out an immediate youthful, trendy and cosmopolitan vibe.”</p>
